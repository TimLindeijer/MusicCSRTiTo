# Group Project

## Group Formation

- **Group Size**: Each group must have 2 members. If you cannot form a group on your own, the lecturer will assign you to a group. Lecturer-assigned groups may have up to 3 members.
- **Registration**: Register your group using [this form](#) by **Oct 2, 16:00**. Groups not registered by the deadline will not be eligible for project points, resulting in course failure.
- **Equal Contribution**: All group members must contribute equally. If unequal contributions are suspected, points may be deducted from the member not contributing sufficiently.
- **Group Changes**: Group changes are not allowed. For extraordinary circumstances (e.g., a member becomes unavailable), contact the lecturer immediately.

## Project Requirements

- **Task**: Develop a conversational music recommender system. The system must meet specified minimum functionality requirements and may include optional features.
- **Requirements**: Requirements will be released in weekly batches, aligned with the topic of the most recent lecture.
  - Each set of requirements includes a list of features, with some being optional.
  - The maximum points for each feature will be specified. Full or partial points may be awarded based on how well the feature works.
  - Each set of requirements builds on the previous ones. It is expected that students complete the requirements in sequential order, as later sets may depend on the implementation of earlier features.
- **Tools and Languages**: You may choose any programming language and tools. Suggested libraries will be provided, but their use is optional.

## Grading Criteria

- **Point Allocation**: Up to 10 points can be earned for each set of requirements (R1â€“R7), totaling a maximum of 70 points for the entire project.
  - Even if multiple optional features are implemented, the maximum points for each set of requirements is capped at 10 points.
- **Assessment Basis**: Grades will be based on the functionality demonstrated in person to the lecturers.
  - You are allowed only one attempt to present and earn points for each set of requirements.
- **In-Person Demonstrations**:
  - Demonstrations can be scheduled during lecture slots on Wednesdays and Fridays. If demand is high, a booking system may be introduced; otherwise, groups should queue to present.
  - All group members are required to attend the in-person demonstrations and be prepared to discuss their contributions in depth.
  - Present at least two sets of requirements during each demonstration for efficient use of time.
  - At least one in-person presentation is required by **Oct 25**. Groups failing to meet this deadline will receive zero points for the entire project, resulting in course failure.

## Requirements

### R1 (Released on Sep 25)

- Provide a web-based chat environment where the user can interact with the conversational music recommender system (MusicCRS) - **4 points**
- The user should be able to add songs to a playlist, remove songs from the playlist, view the playlist, and clear the playlist via natural language instructions or commands via the chat - **4 points**
- [optional] Provide a way for the user to interact more directly with the playlist, not just via the chat - **2 points**
- [optional] Provide a way for the user to learn about the functionality of the system - **2 points**

#### Tools That May Prove Useful:

- [DialogueKit](#) - Python library for building conversational information access systems
